# Web-Social-Information-Extraction

For our project, in order to make the various results viewable with plots, we have chosen to use
Python jupyter notebooks. In addition, the jupyter notebook allowed us to create this pdf file in
which we can explain step by step our code. Our work is organized in 3 notebook files:
<br>
* Wikipedia Cluster
* Twitter Cluster
* Recommender System
<br>
Furthermore, there are also two python files in which we have written some functions that we
used in notebook files:
<br>

* Crawler.py: contains some functions used in cluster analysis of Twitter and Wikipedia
* Recommender_system.py: contains some function used in our recommender system

<br>
All the data genereted by our project are stored in the DATA folder, except for some json file
that would have been too heavy to send.
In the file report.pdf there are all the code explained and the results commented for all steps of our project.
